# Kings and Quadraphages

## Overview
Kings and Quadraphages is a simple, two-player strategy game where the goal is to trap your opponent's king on a 9x9 board. The game allows two players to alternate turns, moving their king and placing pieces called quadraphages to strategically block the opponent.

## Features
- **Two-player mode**: Each player controls a king and 30 quadraphages.
- **Board Setup**: A 9x9 grid where each square can hold a king or a quadraphage.
- **Emojis**: Kings are represented by ðŸ‘‘ emojis, and quadraphages by colored circles (ðŸ”´ for Player 1, ðŸ”µ for Player 2).
- **Simple UI**: Built using Python's Tkinter library for easy interaction.

## How to Play
1. **Move the King**: Each player moves their king ðŸ‘‘ to an adjacent square (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
2. **Place a Quadraphage**: After moving, place a quadraphage (ðŸ”´ or ðŸ”µ) to block squares and try to trap your opponent's king.
3. **Win Condition**: The game ends when a king is completely surrounded by quadraphages, unable to make any further moves.
